\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.2in}|p{2.4in}}
Component & Name & Meaning \\ \hline
${\bm G(Ia)}$     & additive genetic effect or breeding value &  sum of average effects on phenotype of an individual's genes \\
${\bm G(Id)}$     & dominance effect  & sum of deviations from average effect due to non-additive combination of gene effects within a locus \\
${\bm G(Ia:a)}$   & additive x additive epistatic effect & non-additive combination of additive gene effects across pairs of loci \\
${\bm G(Ia:d)}$   & additive x dominance epistatic effect & non-additive combination of additive and dominance gene effects across pairs of loci \\
${\bm G(Id:d)}$   & dominance x dominance epistatic effect & non-additive combination of dominance gene effects across pairs of loci\\ \hline
${\bm E(I)}$      & environmental deviation & unexplained deviation of individual phenotype (assumed environmental, developmental, or measurement error) \\
${\bm E(C)}$      & cohort environmental effect & environmental deviation due to individual belonging to a specific cohort \\ \hline
